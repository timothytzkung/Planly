# Planly
SFU Planly is a degree planning web app for SFU students. Students can upload their goSFU advising transcript pdf in order to show what they still need in a more digestible way. SFU Planly extracts completed courses, in progress courses, and program requirements in order to help students plan future semesters using live course outline data.

Instructions:
1. Navigate to the root folder (not inside backend or frontend; outside)
2. Run `npm run setup` to download dependencies
3. Run `npm run all` to start development

`npm run all` will run frontend and backend in parallel--don't need to change dirs.
