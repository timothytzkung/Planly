# Planly
SFU Planly is a degree planning web app for SFU students. Students can upload their goSFU advising transcript pdf in order to show what they still need in a more digestible way. SFU Planly extracts completed courses, in progress courses, and program requirements in order to help students plan future semesters using live course outline data.

Instructions
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run all`

`npm run all` will run frontend and backend in parallel--don't need to change dirs.
